## A custom serialization of a scene's informations in the unity inspector.

You will no longer insert the wrong scene name when typing it in the string field. In addition, you can decide to load a scene using the `Path`, `Name` or `Build Index` without worrying about changes that can be made to the selected scene.

_What this allows you to do:_

1. _Select scenes from any project folder and serialize the information in the Unity inspector;_
2. _Stores the `Path`, `Name` and `Build Index` informations from selected scene;_
3. _Keeps your selected scene's `Build Index` updated if you change the order of scenes in the build settings;_
4. _Keeps your selected scene's `Path` updated if you change the scene's folder_

## How to use:

Create a _`SceneInspector`_ variable:
```c#
[SerializeField]
private SceneInspector _scene = null;
```

Configure the scene in the inspetor:

Choose which scene info you will use to load the scene:
```c#
SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(_scene.BuildIndex);
//or
SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(_scene.Name);
//or
SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(_scene.Path);
```
