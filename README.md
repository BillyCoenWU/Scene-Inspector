# Scene Inspector

### A custom serialization of a scene's information in the unity inspector.

You will no longer insert the wrong scene name when typing it in the string field. In addition, you can decide to load a scene using the _Path_, _Scene Name_ or _Build Index_, without worrying about changing scene information in case something changes in the project.

What this allows you to do:
1. Select scenes from any project folder and serialize the information in the Unity inspector
2. Stores the _Path_, _Scene Name_ and _Build Index_ informations of the selected scene
3. keeps your selected scene's Build Index updated if you change the order of scenes in the build settings

Working on Unity version 2020.1 or later.
> It will be tested on previous versions of Unity

### Future Updates:
1. More Examples
2. Comment the entire code
3. Inspector Improvement
